          <h3>What is {{ template "inlineLogo" }}? </h3>

          <p class="aboutP">
     TeleSoft (AKA Johnathan Hartsfield) specializes in full stack project 
     development, management, and consultation. TeleSoft can design, create, 
     and deploy web sites and applications from the ground up, or aid your 
     team in doing so. 
          </p>

          <p class="aboutP">
     TeleSoft also specializes in DevOps, designing 
     microservices, and continuous delivery systems for companies 
     and organizations building internal and cloud based software.
          </p>

          <p class="aboutP">
     Typical development is a multi-step process which starts with analyzing 
     the projects scope and designing a linear workflow for completing the 
     project within a clients time-frame. This may include pre-project 
     management such as building a development team (if neccessary) and 
     procurement of certain essential resources.
          </p>

          <h3>FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT</h3>
          <p class="aboutP">
     TeleSoft generally plans for a component based 
     architecture, either directly through template composition or with a third 
     party framework such as React. All projects are designed for long term
     growth and simple maintenance.
          </p>

          <p class="aboutP">
     New projects are designed using the Go programming language for the 
     back-end architecture. 
          </p>

          <h3>DEVOPS, MICROSERVICES, AND <br> CONTINUOUS DELIVERY/INTEGRATION</h3>

          <p class="aboutP">
     Most projects only expose a small percentage of their scope to the client.
     For a complex project to work properly there is often many services 
     running behind the scenes and TeleSoft can design, 
     create, deploy, and maintain these services, or help your team do so.
          </p>

          <p class="aboutP"> 
     TeleSoft implements microservices using the Go 
     programming language. Continuous delivery and integration is implemented 
     by planning and building microservices for each action needed for CD/CI, 
     including unit tests, security audits, version control and backups, 
     staging, final deployment, and whatever other actions maybe neccessary for
     your project. 
          </p>
